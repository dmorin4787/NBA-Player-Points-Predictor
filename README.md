# NBA-Player-Points-Predictor
Creates a dataset of box scores of every game for every NBA player from 1980 to present by scraping data from the web using BS4 and Playwright. A linear regression model is then trained with this data using Scikit-learn to predict the number of points a player will score in an NBA game.
